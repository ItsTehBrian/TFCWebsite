# Hello!
This is the repository for the private website developed for the Minecraft server, The Floating City. It's a creative building, no fly, one of a kind niche server. The IP for the server is `thefloating.city`, and if you're ever looking for a unique server with a friendly playerbase, consider checking it out!

## Why is this public?
Currently this website is just for sketching out ideas for the actual released website. I'm not sure if it'll be a static website like it is now, or forums, like Xenforo or Discourse. GitHub Pages is only free if the repository is public, so here we are!

## Alright, so how can I contribute?
If you see any bugs, typos, or anything that can be improved, feel free to submit a pull request or file an issue. I welcome even the smallest issues or nitpicks. I'm not currently using any frameworks or anything, just pure CSS and maybe a hint of JavaScript, who knows.

## This README is pretty empty, where's the rest?
There's a much better README you can find at the server's custom plugin's repository, [here](https://github.com/ItsTehBrian/TFCPlugin).
