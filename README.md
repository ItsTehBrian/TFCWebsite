# TFCWebsite
This is the is a website for the [The Floating City](https://thefloating.city), which is a creative building, no fly, one-of-a-kind-niche Minecraft server. If that sounds any interesting to you, come check us out sometime, yeah? 

Currently, the website isn't too great, just basic HTML with a bit of JavaScript. I'm hoping that in the future it'll be built with a proper, modern web framework, but I haven't learned any of those yet.. I'm hoping someone else might be able to help me with that!

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute, feel free to submit a pull request or file an issue. I welcome even the smallest issues or nitpicks! Heck, got an idea for a complete makeover of the site? Make a pr and I'll gladly take a look at it! :)
